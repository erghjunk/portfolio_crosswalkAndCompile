# Python Portfolio - Crosswalk and Compile 

Python script to dynamically compile external data for records in a spreadsheet.

This script was written to gather external data (13 values) for each of a set of records
(grant projets awarded from a specific program). Some of those values needed to be pulled
from a spreadsheet dated 3 years prior to the year the grant was awarded (to match the
data used by the grantee at the time of application), and some needed to be pulled from the
year of award. This script compiles them all.

Downloading the contents of the repo to a single file will allow you to run the script.
